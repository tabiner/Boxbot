    <p class="story">
      In 2025, the world will enter an era in which robots will be prevalent in every household. 
      Dr. Pencil has developed a convenient factory transport robot that makes full use of the latest technology at the time. 
      Until then, robots were not yet able to think and move on their own, but this robot was created to be able to do so. 
      It's very difficult to think for yourself and you have to be able to safely pass through every part of the factory. 
      This robot was one of those prototypes. 
      This robot needs to pass many tests to prove it is perfect.
